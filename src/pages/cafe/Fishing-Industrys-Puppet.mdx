## Fishing Industry’s Puppet?
Iver Sandvik, the Oceanists’ leader, has long been a fierce advocate for Elvfjord’s fishing industry, but rumors are bubbling up that he may be a “puppet” for the industry’s powerful figures. Although Sandvik’s platform has been to protect fishing jobs and the town’s heritage, a few critics argue that he’s simply acting in the interest of the wealthier fishery owners.

However, beyond his strong stance on preserving the fishing industry, there’s no clear evidence to support this idea. Sandvik’s campaign continues to center on preserving Elvfjord’s traditional way of life, yet the speculation about his independence as a leader lingers. For now, the claims remain mere conjecture, with no ties to fishery owners substantiated.
