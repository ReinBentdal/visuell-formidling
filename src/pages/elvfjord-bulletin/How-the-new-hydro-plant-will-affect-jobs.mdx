## How the new hydro plant will affect jobs
As the debate over Elvfjord’s proposed hydroelectric plant intensifies, the question of how it will impact local jobs has become a central issue in the town’s election. According to the Workers Party, the plant represents a major opportunity for job creation, but the Oceanists and local fishery workers fear it could spell disaster for the town’s historic fishing industry.

The Workers Party has positioned the hydro plant as a much-needed economic boost for Elvfjord. Party leader Henrik Olsen says the plant will not only provide hundreds of construction jobs but also create long-term positions in plant maintenance, operations, and energy management. “This plant is a chance to modernize our economy and offer stable, well-paying jobs to the people of Elvfjord,” Olsen explains. “It’s not just about energy—it’s about giving our town a future.”

On the other hand, the Oceanists argue that the hydro plant could devastate the local fishing industry, which has been the backbone of Elvfjord for generations. The plant’s location on the river could disrupt salmon migration, putting the livelihoods of local fishermen at risk. “If the salmon can’t reach the fjord, we lose everything,” warns Oceanist leader Iver Sandvik. “It’s not just jobs—it’s our way of life.”

Local fishery workers share this concern. Lars Eriksen, a fisherman who’s been in the industry for over 30 years, is skeptical of the promises made by the Workers Party. “I understand the need for new jobs, but at what cost? If this plant ruins the salmon runs, there won’t be any fish left to catch. What happens to us then?” Eriksen asks.

While the hydro plant could bring new employment opportunities, the threat it poses to the fishing industry has left many Elvfjord residents divided. Some see it as a necessary step toward economic revitalization, while others worry it could sacrifice long-standing jobs for a project that isn’t guaranteed to succeed. As the town heads into the election, the debate over jobs is likely to remain at the forefront, with both sides making their case for what’s best for Elvfjord’s future.
