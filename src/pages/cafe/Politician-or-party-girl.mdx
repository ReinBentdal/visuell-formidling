# Politician or party girl?
Lina Berge, the young and idealistic leader of Elvfjord’s Green Party, has made waves with her strong stance on environmental issues, but rumors are swirling that her dedication to politics might not be as solid as it seems. Several sources claim to have spotted Berge out at local clubs and bars late into the night, raising questions about whether she’s truly fit to lead a serious political movement.

One unnamed resident said, "I’ve seen her out more than a few times, laughing with friends and dancing. She’s supposed to be focused on saving our environment, but it seems like she’s more interested in partying than policymaking." Although there’s no hard evidence to back these claims, some are wondering if Lina’s nightlife habits are overshadowing her political responsibilities.

Critics argue that her behavior suggests a lack of maturity and commitment to the role she’s taken on. "We need a leader who’s in the office, not on the dance floor," one opponent remarked, adding that it’s hard to take her seriously as a politician when she’s seen out socializing so often.

Despite the weak nature of these accusations, the image of Berge as a "party girl" is starting to gain traction among those looking to undermine her leadership. Whether this is a genuine concern or just an attempt to discredit a rising political star, only time will tell. However, with election day approaching, voters will have to decide if Lina Berge’s nightlife is really a factor in her ability to lead—or just a distraction from her message.
